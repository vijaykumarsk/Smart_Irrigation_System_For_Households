# Smart_Irrigation_System_For_Households
INTRODUCTION:
Irrigation is an artificial application of watering the land for agricultural production. The requirement of water to the soil depends on soil properties such as soil moisture and soil temperature. Effective irrigation can influence the entire growth process and automation in irrigation system using modern technology can be used to provide better irrigation management. In general, most of the irrigation systems are manually operated. These traditional techniques can be replaced with automated techniques of irrigation in order to use the water efficiently and effectively. 
A sensor based automated irrigation system provides promising solution to farmers where the presence of a farmer in field is not compulsory during irrigation process.

ABSTRACT:
This project is an automatic watering system for the plant which automatically waters the plant without human engagement with the system. 
As we are using a soil moisture sensor [3] that senses the moisture content in the soil it sends this data to the Arduino that we are using. We insert the soil moisture sensor in the soil and connect it to the Arduino and the sensor sends the data to the Arduino about the moisture inside the soil and if the soil moisture sensor detects no moisture or very less moisture then the pump will get started and watering the plants. 
This system recognizes the less moisture content soil into the various field. In this project, the water pipe is connected to the servo motor [2] which rotates according to the requirement. If there are two crops A & B and if A is having less amount of moisture then the servo motor rotates toward the crop A and starts the watering and when it fills up it will rotate towards the crop B. 
A LCD display is also attached to the arduino to show the current status of watering going on. A Bluetooth Module is also attached to send the watering notification to the App of  the smart phone. An Ultrasonic Sensor is used to measure the water level in the water source.
